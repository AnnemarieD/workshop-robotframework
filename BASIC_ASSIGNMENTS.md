## Basic Assignments
### Setup Settings 

### Creating variables
Create a new robot file with settings, variables and test cases

Define some variables of different types (scalar, list, dictionary)

Log the variables through one or more test cases: 
- Log a scalar variable
- Log de 3th value of a dictionary
- Log the 2nd list item

Use the [documentation](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html) if needed.

### Creating keywords and assertions
Create a test that passes using the built-in keyword 'Should Be Equal' and the variables you created earlier.

Create a test that fails using 'Should be Equal'.

Create a test using 'Should be Equal', checking the first item of a list variable.

Create 3 new tests using different assertion keywords.

Use the [documentation](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Keywords) if needed.

### Creating keywords with arguments
Create a keyword that checks the 2nd value of a list. Use this keyword in a test case.

Make the keyword variable by checking the nth value instead of the 2nd value (use Arguments).

Add to your test to check the 1st list item.
Add to your test to check the 3th list item.

### Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
Create a test for checking the nth value of a list using given-when-then keywords.

### Data Driven Tests
Rewrite your test from the previous assignment to use a template setting for your entire suite (under Settings).

Rewrite your test to use a template setting for a specific test case (under Test Cases).

### Extra: Create additional tests
Go to www.saucedemo.com and check out the login feature. Create the following tests with all you've learned during the workshop:
- Create a test with a valid login
- Create a test with an invalid login
- Check that the title of the website is "Swag Labs"
- Check that the number of products advertised is 6
